Rise of the Dead : 
A zombie text-based game, inspired by the Walking Dead series.

================

Story Summary:
You’ve woken up in a hospital bed after being involved in a horrific accident while rock climbing. While you were recovering, a zombie outbreak has occurred leaving the world as you knew it turned on its head. You must navigate your way out of the hospital to get back home where you’ll find your family and some answers surrounding the last few weeks events. Your room is on the 3rd floor of the hospital. Be sure to find some medicine from the pharmacy to treat your partially healed wounds before leaving.

Controls:
Classic text-based game controls allow the character to interact with their environment by "look", "move", "take", and "drop" commands. 

Future work:
0) An inventory system and staminia based carry capacity for players.
1) A combat system to fight zombies and other enemies.
2) Interactions with friendly / neutral NPCs.
3) Suggest a new feature you'd like to see or submit a pull request. :)


Change Log:

v0.1 - Initial version of game. Failed to function for even basic features due to design flaws. 
       Project sat untouched for several months.
